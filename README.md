# fullstack-pulumi-mern-digitalocean

This repo is a template repository intended to accompany the walkthrough at <https://pulumi.com/blog/fullstack-pulumi-mern-stack-digitalocean>, which shows you how to deploy and manage a MERN application with DigitalOcean and Pulumi. The `main` branch contains the front-end and back-end components of the application, and the [`finished`](https://github.com/cnunciato/fullstack-pulumi-mern-digitalocean/tree/finished) branch contains the completed Pulumi programs.

See the blog post for details!
